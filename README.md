# Pencil-Drawing-Website

This is a personal project which I made to exercise CSS skills. 
<ul>
  <li>Fully responsive design</li>
  <li>I used AOS (Animate On Scroll) library for animation</li>
  <li>Different image loading according to devices screen size you visit the website</li>
  <li>Not loading youtube videos until you click them</li>
</ul>
